# Project 2
**Description:** For this project, we took a time series dataset and attempted to model its trend and seasonality component. The dataset we used was monthly air passenger traffic for the San Francisco International Airport. 

  * First, we used different models to attempt to model the trend of the data. The models we fit were a traditional linear fit and a quadratic + periodic nonlinear fit as well. We then used the AIC/BIC criterion to select the preferred model fit for the trend and computed a forecast
  *  Next, we looked at both an additive and multiplicative seasonal adjustment and decomposition for the data.
  *  Lastly we chose the optimal model fit and used that model to forecast the series.
