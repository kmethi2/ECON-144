# Econ 144 Economics Forecasting Projects
## By Krish Methi

* This repository contains a collection of the projects I worked on for Economics 144 - Economic Forecasting in the Winter of 2024. 

* This course covered topics such as time series forecasting, forecasting trend seasonality and cycles, modeling of time series data, and much more.

* There are three projects I worked on using R. The first project dealt with modeling the trend and seasonality of a time series to prepare a forecast. The second project had a similar scope, however it also involved modeling cycles and had an increased complexity in terms of analyzing accuracy. The third project was the most complex, combining all the various models we studied and fitting them to another time series dataset and finding the most optimal model.

* We studied many models, including:
  *   Arima, ETS, Holt-Winters, Prophet, NNETAR(neural networks autoregression), ARCH/GARCH, state space models(Kalman Filter for example), VAR, STL decomposition, Dynamic Harmonic Regression, Thief and MAPA, Cointegration, and a combination of these models as well. Most of these models were incorporated in our projects. 

* We found our own datasets to use for these projects.

* Each project will be detailed further in their own respective folders.
